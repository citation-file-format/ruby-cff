### Synopsis

This library provides a Ruby interface to create and edit Citation File Format (CFF) files. The resulting files can be validated against a formal schema to ensure correctness and can be output in a number of different citation-friendly formats.

The primary API entry points are the `Index` and `File` classes.

See the [CITATION.cff documentation](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) for more details about the Citation File Format.

See the [full API documentation](https://citation-file-format.github.io/ruby-cff/) for more details about Ruby CFF.

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'cff'
```

And then execute:
```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself with:
```shell
$ gem install cff
```

### Quick start

You can quickly build and save a CFF index like this:

```ruby
index = CFF::Index.new('Ruby CFF Library') do |cff|
  cff.version = CFF::VERSION
  cff.date_released = Date.today
  cff.authors << CFF::Person.new('Robert', 'Haines')
  cff.license = 'Apache-2.0'
  cff.keywords << 'ruby' << 'credit' << 'citation'
  cff.repository_artifact = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/cff'
  cff.repository_code = 'https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff'
end

CFF::File.write('CITATION.cff', index)
```

Which will produce a file that looks something like this:

```yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: If you use this software in your work, please cite it using the following metadata
title: Ruby CFF Library
authors:
- family-names: Haines
  given-names: Robert
keywords:
- ruby
- credit
- citation
version: 1.0.0
date-released: 2022-10-01
license: Apache-2.0
repository-artifact: https://rubygems.org/gems/cff
repository-code: https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff
```

`CFF::File` can be used to create a file directly, and it exposes the underlying `CFF::Index` directly. If using a block with `CFF::File::open` the file will get written on closing it:

```ruby
CFF::File.open('CITATION.cff') do |cff|
  cff.version = CFF::VERSION
  cff.date_released = Date.today
  cff.authors << CFF::Person.new('Robert', 'Haines')
  cff.license = 'Apache-2.0'
  cff.keywords << 'ruby' << 'credit' << 'citation'
  cff.repository_artifact = 'https://rubygems.org/gems/cff'
  cff.repository_code = 'https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff'
end
```

You can read a CFF file quickly with `CFF::File::read`:

```ruby
cff = CFF::File.read('CITATION.cff')
```

And you can read a CFF file from memory with `CFF::Index::read` or `CFF::Index::open` - as with `CFF::File` a block can be passed in to `open`:

```ruby
cff_string = ::File.read('CITATION.cff')
cff = CFF::Index.read(cff_string)

CFF::Index.open(cff_string) do |cff|
  # Edit cff here...
end
```

To quickly reference other software from your own CFF file, you can use `CFF::Reference.from_cff`. This example uses the CFF file from the core CFF repository as a reference for the Ruby CFF repository:

```ruby
require 'open-uri'

uri = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/main/CITATION.cff'
other_cff = URI(uri).open.read

ref = CFF::Reference.from_cff(CFF::Index.read(other_cff))

CFF::File.open('CITATION.cff') do |cff|
  cff.references = [ref]
end
```

### Validating CFF files

To quickly validate a file and raise an error on failure, you can use `CFF::File` directly:

```ruby
begin
  CFF::File.validate!('CITATION.cff')
rescue CFF::ValidationError => e
  # Handle validation errors here...
end
```

Both `CFF::File` and `CFF::Index` have instance methods to validate CFF files as well:

```ruby
cff = CFF::File.read('CITATION.cff')
begin
  cff.validate!(fail_fast: true)
rescue CFF::ValidationError => e
  # Handle validation errors here...
end
```

Non-bang methods (`validate`) return an array, with `true`/`false` at index 0 to indicate pass/fail, and an array of errors at index 1 (if any).

Passing `fail_fast: true` (default: `false`) will cause the validator to abort on the first error it encounters and report just that. Only the instance methods on `CFF::File` and `CFF::Index` provide the `fail_fast` option.

The validation methods (both class and instance) on `File` also validate the filename of a CFF file; in normal circumstances a CFF file should be named 'CITATION.cff'. You can switch this behaviour off by passing `fail_on_filename: false`. The non-bang methods (`validate`) on `File` return an extra value in the result array: `true`/`false` at index 2 to indicate whether the filename passed/failed validation.

### Outputting citation text

This library can use CFF data to output text suitable for use when citing software. Currently the output formats supported are:

* BibTeX; and
* an APA-like format.

You can use this feature as follows:
```ruby
cff = CFF::File.read('CITATION.cff')

cff.to_bibtex
cff.to_apalike
```

These methods assume that the CFF data is valid - see the notes on validation above.

Assuming the same CFF data as above, the two formats will look something like this:

#### BibTeX format

```tex
@software{Haines_Ruby_CFF_Library_2022,
author = {Haines, Robert},
license = {Apache-2.0},
month = {10},
title = {{Ruby CFF Library}},
url = {https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff},
version = {1.0.0},
year = {2022}
}
```

#### APA-like format

```
Haines, R. (2022). Ruby CFF Library (Version 1.0.0) [Computer software]. https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff
```

#### Citing a paper rather than software

The CFF has been designed with direct citation of software in mind. We'd like software to be considered a first-class research output, like journal articles and conference papers. If you would rather that your citation text points to a paper that describes your software, rather than the software itself, you can use the `preferred-citation` field for that paper. When producing citation text this library will honour `preferred-citation`, if present, by default. If you would like to specify a `preferred-citation` and still produce a direct citation to the software then you can configure the formatter as follows:

```ruby
cff = CFF::File.read('CITATION.cff')

cff.to_bibtex(preferred_citation: false)
cff.to_apalike(preferred_citation: false)
```

#### A note on citation formats

Due to the different expectations of different publication venues, the citation text may need minor tweaking to be used in specific situations. If you spot a major, or general, error in the output do [let us know](https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff/issues), but please check against the [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/format/) and [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references) standards first.

### Library versions

From version 1.0.0 onwards, the principles of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) are applied when numbering releases with new features or breaking changes.

Minor or stylistic changes to output formats are not considered "breaking" for the purposes of library versioning.
